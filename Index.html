    <p> My favorite hobby is reading books because it gives you knowledge about many facts. about history, geography, plants, animals, and much more. It widens your imagination and gives you a new perspective about things. It improves your grammar and vocabulary. It makes you thoughtful and knwledgable. It opens you to many issues around the world, and even improves your memory.</p>
